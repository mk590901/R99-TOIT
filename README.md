# R99-TOIT

The repository contains two applications in the __Toit__ language from __Toitware__, which allow access to a __BLE__ device, connection to its services, and reading the required information.

## Introduction

The device I'm trying to access via __BLE__ is a very inexpensive Chinese __smart ring__ marketed as a __smart health care__ device. In addition to __fitness__ information, it can measure several parameters such as __oxygen__, __heart rate__, and __blood pressure__. According to the info from __nRF__ application, the __heart rate service__ (__0x180D__) is __accessable__ on device, and this parameter can be measured, readed, and for  instance saved to a __cloud database__ using the __REST API__.
